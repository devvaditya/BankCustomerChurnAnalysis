## Key Insights

1. September Month Experienced the most numbers of Active Members for the bank whereas November month had the most Inactive Members.
2. Female customers are more likely to churn when compared to Male ones.
3. Germany Branch had more Inactive Members (1261) than Active Members (1248)
4. Members in the ‘Fair’ Category of Credit or those in the Credit Score range of 580-669 are most likely to churn.

## Recommendations

1. Investigate what drives customer acquisition in September. Explore replicating successful strategies throughout the year.
2. Dig deeper to understand why female customers churn at a higher rate. Segment your customer base by gender and analyze their account activity and product usage patterns. This might reveal unmet needs specific to female customers.
3.  Analyze local market conditions and customer demographics in Germany to pinpoint potential causes.
4. Develop targeted customer retention strategies for members with a "Fair" credit score. This could involve offering them financial literacy programs, personalized product recommendations, or hardship programs to help them improve their financial health.
